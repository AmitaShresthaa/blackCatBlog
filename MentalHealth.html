        <p> From being a taboo to becoming a mainstream conversation, mental health has emerged as one of the most 
            significant topics of the century. The rise of mental health awareness, amplified by social media, 
            has created a safe space for individuals to express themselves and share their experiences
             However, like any positive change, it has come with challenges.
        </p>

        <p>Society has shifted from denying mental health issues to a concerning trend of self-diagnosing—or 
           often misdiagnosing—these conditions. This has led to the overuse and misuse of certain terms, 
           causing them to lose their true meaning and, in some cases, undermining the experiences of those genuinely 
           struggling.</p>

        <p>
            In this blog, we will explore some of the most commonly misunderstood and misused mental health terms,
            highlighting the potential harm this trend poses and emphasizing the importance of accurate understanding and responsible dialogu 
        </p>

        <p>
            Let’s consider the well-known Aesop’s fable, “The Boy Who Cried Wolf.” The story begins with a shepherd boy who 
            repeatedly tricks the villagers by falsely claiming that a wolf is attacking the flock. Over time, the villagers 
            grow weary of his lies and stop taking his warnings seriously. Eventually, 
            when a real wolf does attack, the boy cries out for help, but no one believes him, and the wolf devours the sheep.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In a similar way, while the internet has played a remarkable role in spreading mental health awareness, 
            the misuse and overuse of terms like depression, anxiety, OCD, and ADHD have created a troubling parallel 
            to the boy’s cries in the story. These serious mental health conditions are being overused and normalized in 
            casual conversations, often equated with minor inconveniences or temporary feelings. This trivialization can lead 
            to significant harm by discouraging those genuinely affected from seeking the help they need.
        </p>

        <p>
            A troubling trend contributing to this issue is self-diagnosis, fueled by internet influencers who share 
            superficial descriptions of mental health conditions. Their followers, often without proper context or professional 
            evaluation, adopt these labels for themselves, using them casually in everyday life. This behavior not only
            perpetuates misunderstandings but can also lead to apophenia—the tendency to perceive connections or patterns where none exist—among the general public.
        </p>

        <p>
            The consequences of this normalization and self-diagnosis are far-reaching. It risks creating a stigma 
            around seeking professional help, dilutes the seriousness of these conditions, and even limits access to 
            essential resources for those who truly need them. By treating mental health conditions as trendy buzzwords
            rather than serious medical issues, we undermine the very awareness and understanding the internet has worked so hard to promote.
